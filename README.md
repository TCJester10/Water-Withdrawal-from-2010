# Water Withdrawal from 2010
Using data from 2010s water usage report, I used R's GGplot tool and data I put together myself to chart water withdrawal from different usage categories.

* As can be seen, most usage categories saw a decline in their usage, while Livestock staid static, Mining and Irrigation went up.
